TestNG---stands for testing next generation(or unit testing framework)
TestNG is also called TDD(Test driven development)--basically used in agile methodologies.

purpose(Advantages):-
--designed test cases in a systematic way
--Generate good html reports
--Provide different annotations
--We give priorities/sequence of the test cases 
--dependency(i.e. one test case is depend on other test case)
--grouping
--data provider--execute same test case again and again multiple times(like login page where multiple times i have to use username and password)

TestNG---open source and free  

It is available in the JAR files.
Testng is also called Java unit testing framework(only available or used in Java).


Assertion-- It is a type of validation where we check the expected and actual result.


<<<Execute the tests in paralle using TestNG>>>
What is parallel execution
Why do we need it
How to perform it

Sequential--one after the other.
Parallel--side by side.

when parallel=none and parallel=false in testNG.xml then test cases are execute in sequential order.
when thread count=1 then test cases are run in sequential order.
thread count should not be in negative otherwise it gives Illegal Argument Exception.

SEQUENCE IN TESTNG.XML :--
<SUITE>   
  <TEST>    
    <CLASSES>    
        <CLASS>   
            <METHOD>
            in method tag we can use include tag and exclude tag that which method we have to run and which one not.
            </METHOD>
        </CLASS> 
    </CLASSES>     
  </TEST>        
</SUITE>
